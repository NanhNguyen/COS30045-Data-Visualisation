# COS30045-Data-Visualisation

GenAI Declaration – Exercise 0.2

Generative AI (ChatGPT) was used in this exercise to assist with:

Basic website structure planning

JavaScript navigation logic

CSS styling guidance

Generating placeholder content

All generated suggestions were reviewed, modified, and implemented by the student.
The final submission reflects the student’s own understanding and work.

## TV Energy Consumption Data Story (Exercise 3)

## Data Story

### Audience

The target audience for this visualisation is **Australian consumers** who want to purchase a new television and are interested in comparing models based on **energy consumption and efficiency**.  
This audience may not have strong technical knowledge, so the visualisations must be simple, clear, and easy to interpret.

### Audience Goals

The audience is mainly interested in:

- Which TV screen technologies are most common in Australia
- Which technologies consume less power
- Whether larger screen sizes consume more electricity

### Storytelling Guidelines

To communicate insights clearly, the website follows these design guidelines:

- Use simple charts such as bar charts and scatter plots
- Include short explanations next to each chart
- Use a consistent colour theme and clean layout
- Focus on energy-related insights rather than technical TV specifications

## About the Data

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the **TV energy consumption dataset** provided for COS30045 Data Visualisation.

### Data Processing

The dataset was processed using KNIME.
Processing steps included:

- Removing irrelevant columns
- Filtering and grouping data to count screen technology frequencies
- Calculating mean power consumption values
- Converting screen size measurements into a consistent format where needed
- Generating charts such as bar charts and scatter plots

### Privacy

The dataset contains product-related information only and does not include personal or identifying user information.  
Therefore, privacy risk is minimal.

### Accuracy and Limitations

Some limitations of the dataset include:

- The dataset may not represent all TVs available in Australia
- Some entries may have missing or inconsistent values
- Power consumption can vary depending on brightness settings and user behaviour
- The dataset only represents the recorded values and may not match real-world household usage

### Ethics

This project aims to help users make better decisions about energy efficiency.  
The visualisations are designed to avoid misleading conclusions by:

- showing clear labels and units
- not exaggerating differences
- using charts appropriate to the data type

## GenAI Declaration (Exercise 3)

Generative AI (ChatGPT) was used in this project to assist with:

- Structuring the README.md file
- Suggesting website content structure for data storytelling
- Providing guidance on suitable chart types and visual design principles
- Supporting HTML/CSS improvements for the website theme

All suggestions were reviewed, modified, and implemented by the student.
The final submission reflects the student’s own understanding and work.
