      <h1>Television Energy Consumption in Australia</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Why does TV energy consumption matter?</h2>
        <p>
          Many Australian households use televisions daily for entertainment,
          gaming, and streaming. However, televisions can contribute
          significantly to household electricity bills, especially when the
          screen size is large or the TV uses older screen technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          This page explores energy consumption patterns across different
          television screen technologies, screen sizes, and power usage to help
          consumers make more informed purchasing decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The main audience for this data story is Australian consumers and
          households who are planning to purchase a new television and want to
          balance screen quality with energy efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>The audience is likely interested in practical answers such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Which screen technology is most common?</li>
          <li>Which technology uses the least power?</li>
          <li>Does a bigger screen always consume more electricity?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          Question 1: What screen technologies are most common in Australia?
        </h2>

        <p>
          To answer this question, the dataset was grouped by
          <strong>Screen_Tech</strong> and the number of TV models in each
          category was counted. A <strong>bar chart</strong> was chosen because
          it allows easy comparison between categories and makes the most common
          technologies immediately visible.
        </p>

        <h3>Chart: Frequency of TV Screen Technologies</h3>

        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong>Insight:</strong> LED-based technologies appear most
          frequently, suggesting that they are the dominant TV type currently
          available in Australia. Older technologies such as Plasma appear less
          often, which may indicate they are being phased out.

        <h2>Question 2: Which screen technology consumes the least power?</h2>

        <p>
          This question focuses on energy efficiency. The dataset was grouped by
          <strong>Screen_Tech</strong> and the average power consumption was
          calculated using the <strong>Power</strong> column.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <strong>bar chart</strong> was chosen because it clearly compares
          average values across multiple groups.
        </p>

        <h3>Chart: Average Power Consumption by Screen Technology</h3>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong>Insight:</strong> Technologies such as LED and OLED tend to
          have lower average power consumption compared to older technologies.
          This suggests that consumers who want to reduce electricity costs
          should prioritise modern display technologies.

        <h2>
          Question 3: What is the relationship between screen size and power
          use?
        </h2>

        <p>
          To explore this relationship, a <strong>scatter plot</strong> was
          chosen because it is the best chart type for examining correlations
          between two numerical variables.
        </p>

        <p>
          The x-axis represents <strong>Screen Size (inches)</strong>, and the
          y-axis represents <strong>Power (W)</strong>. Each dot represents one
          TV model in the dataset.
        </p>

        <h3>Chart: Screen Size vs Power Consumption</h3>

            Figure 3: Scatter plot comparing screen size and power consumption.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong>Insight:</strong> There is a clear positive relationship
          between screen size and power use. Larger TVs generally consume more
          electricity, but there are also differences between models, suggesting
          that energy efficiency depends not only on size but also on technology
          and model design.

        <h2>Conclusion and Recommendation</h2>

        <p>
          This data story shows that modern screen technologies such as LED and
          OLED are the most common in Australia and are generally more
          energy-efficient. The analysis also confirms that larger screen sizes
          tend to consume more power, which may increase household electricity
          bills.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Recommendation:</strong> If a household wants to reduce energy
          consumption, they should consider choosing a modern LED/OLED
          television and avoid unnecessarily large screen sizes unless required.
        </p>

        <h2>How were the charts created?</h2>

        <p>
          The dataset was explored and aggregated using KNIME. GroupBy and
          aggregation nodes were used to calculate frequencies and average power
          consumption. Charts were then generated and exported as images for use
          in this website.
        </p>

        <p>
          This approach supports transparency and ensures that the results shown
          on the website can be reproduced.
